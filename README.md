## A statement. Presented in React/Redux.

### to get going, clone the repo and then run:

`npm install`

### then, you might want to
run tests:

`npm test`

start the project:

`npm run dev`

build the project:

`npm build`

### discussion:

There are several things here that are not ideal. However, this shows a bit about how I like to develop React/Redux applications at the moment.

First off, for one, single page, this is way over doing it :)

The project should hot reload for changes to both JavaScript and CSS.
The project is tested fairly well.
