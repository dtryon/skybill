## A statement. Presented in React/Redux.

### to get going, clone the repo and then run:

`npm install`

### then, you might want to
#### run tests:
`npm test`

#### start the project:
`npm run dev`

This will start the project at: http://localhost:8080

#### build the project:
`npm run build`

### discussion:

There are several things here that are not ideal. However, this shows a bit about how I like to develop React/Redux applications at the moment.

First off, for one, single page, this is way over doing it :)

The CSS grid is very simple, but kind-of works for this page.  However, it could be more responsive (when dealing with subscriptions).

The page reads alright with a screen reader, but could be much better. Adding more aria attributes would help.

#### All this considered...
The project should hot reload for changes to both JavaScript and CSS.
The project is tested fairly well.

Looking forward to feedback :)
